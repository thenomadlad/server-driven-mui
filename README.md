This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server for server-driven-mui:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Start a backend server - python flask

Start the flask server by changing to sdmui-python and running the flask app using poetry
```bash
cd sdmui-python
poetry run flask run --reload
```

### Open the backend UI for the python service

Open a browser and go to this URL: http://localhost:3000/http/localhost:5000/nice_table_demo

At this point you should be seeing a page with a table containing the data served by the python app
